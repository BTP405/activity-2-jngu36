#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

The functino creates an empty array and iterates through a for loop from 1 to N (starting from 0) and for each value, append it to the array but the value is doubled. The array is returned.

The for loop iterates through the returned array and for each value, it prints the value and replaces newline with " : "

```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
The bracket is an array that is filled with code that iterates through a range of 1 to 5 (0 to 4) but the value is doubled giving us [0,2,4,6,8] and the for loop iterates through the array, printing the value and replacing newline with " : "
```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```

The doubleG function iterates through a for loop and for each value, it generates a value of i timems 2 and returns it to another for loop that is iterating through the values returned by the function which then prints the value and replaces newline with ' : '
